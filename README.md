# Blackjack

## Idea:
This project simulates the blackjack game since I'm quite interested in playing card games.

## Features:
* Currently playing against a bot (single play mode) is available, multiple play mode will be available in the near future.
* You will receive 10000 € at the beginning and 1000 € every day. The money here plays no significant role, it just serves as making you feel you actually play a blackjack in real life.
* Supported languages: Vietnamese and English

## Run locally: 
```bash
ng serve --open
```
